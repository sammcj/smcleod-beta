<p>This comes from a Platform Engineering / Team Lead and DevOps culture perspective more than from a framework / methodology perspective (Agile or otherwise) as for me I&amp;rsquo;ve found over the years that:</p>
<ol>
<li><em><strong>The idea and message is stronger than the system</strong> or controls, and <strong>when embraced creates a shared vision</strong></em>.</li>
<li><em>There is great value in people <strong>embracing a shared vision</strong> and <strong>ideas that are bigger than themselves</strong></em>.</li>
