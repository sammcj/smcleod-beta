This is a simple way to make work visible, share knowledge, reduce context switching, avoid silos and share the support load.</p></p><p><a href=https://beta.smcleod.net/2022/10/making-work-visible-avoid-dms/>Continue reading </a></p></div></div><hr></article><article class="card postlistitem"><div><h2><a href=https://beta.smcleod.net/2021/07/rancilio-silvia-upgrade/>Rancilio Silvia Upgrade</a></h2><p class=date><span title=Date></span>
