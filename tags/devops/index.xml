&lt;hr>
&lt;p>This comes from a Platform Engineering / Team Lead and DevOps culture perspective more than from a framework / methodology perspective (Agile or otherwise) as for me I&amp;rsquo;ve found over the years that:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;em>&lt;strong>The idea and message is stronger than the system&lt;/strong> or controls, and &lt;strong>when embraced creates a shared vision&lt;/strong>&lt;/em>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;em>There is great value in people &lt;strong>embracing a shared vision&lt;/strong> and &lt;strong>ideas that are bigger than themselves&lt;/strong>&lt;/em>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;em>Take the best ideas, ways of working, and ceremonies from delivery frameworks (e.g. Agile, Kanban, Lean etc&amp;hellip;) rather than trying to &amp;lsquo;implement&amp;rsquo; a single one verbatim&lt;/em>.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;DevOps is &amp;hellip; not a job title&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s more of a cultural practice, like innovation, and it makes just as little sense hiring &amp;ldquo;innovation engineers&amp;rdquo; and expecting your organisation to be innovative, without also creating the culture to foster innovation.&amp;rdquo; (Joel Shea when responding to this posted on &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-6564991913110368256-WxFP">LinkedIn&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In most cases it&amp;rsquo;s clear the organisation doesn&amp;rsquo;t truly know what they want or need and likely don&amp;rsquo;t understand the nuances of the aspects of engineering.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The problem is - they&amp;rsquo;re going to end up with a ‘Camel Dressed As A Unicorn&amp;rsquo; rather than someone with deep or natural engineering understanding in the areas they most need to help see, discuss, solve problems and deliver effective and lasting solutions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>From the what I&amp;rsquo;ve seen recently companies hiring with &amp;lsquo;DevOps Engineer&amp;rsquo; titles - the organisation (thinks they) want / need a Developer with a little bit of Operations experience - but not a true understanding of Operations or platform engineering.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m almost certain they&amp;rsquo;re trying to appeal to the hype (in a genuine effort to find someone highly skilled) but as they&amp;rsquo;re missing the point of where people&amp;rsquo;s skills lay and what those skills mean - they&amp;rsquo;re confusing engineers, recruiters and likely themselves further.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="devops-is-_deeply_-important">DevOps is &lt;em>deeply&lt;/em> important&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Likely the most important thing to succeed at product and systems delivery - but it&amp;rsquo;s not a job title.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you need Developers to work in a DevOps culture and environment - say so.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you need Operations or Platform Engineers to work in a DevOps culture and environment - say so.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Staying either of those does not mutually exclude ones abilities to know &amp;lsquo;a bit of the other side&amp;rsquo;, e.g. a Developer that has worked closely with a CI/CD system&amp;rsquo;s backend or Kubernetes Operations, or an Operations Engineer that has worked closely with Developers and Testers and can work with APIs: or whip up some integration scripts when needed.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Looking For New Opportunities</title><link>https://beta.smcleod.net/2019/08/looking-for-new-opportunities/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Aug 2019 10:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://beta.smcleod.net/2019/08/looking-for-new-opportunities/</guid><description>&lt;p>As stated in &lt;a href="https://smcleod.net/tech/2019/06/29/leaving-infoxchange.html">my announcement post&lt;/a> - after 7~ years, I resigned from Infoxchange several months ago.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I planned on taking a holiday, relaxing, decompressing, dipping my toes in some off-the-shelf tech I haven&amp;rsquo;t spent a lot of time with and performing some personal growth through reading a number of books that have been sitting on my &amp;rsquo;to read&amp;rsquo; shelf.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is exactly what I&amp;rsquo;ve done.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Leaving Infoxchange</title><link>https://beta.smcleod.net/2019/06/leaving-infoxchange/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Jun 2019 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://beta.smcleod.net/2019/06/leaving-infoxchange/</guid><description>&lt;p>After 7~ years, I have resigned from Infoxchange.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>In 2012 I was hired to work with &lt;a href="https://www.infoxchange.org">Infoxchange&lt;/a> to &lt;em>&amp;ldquo;shake things up&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em> (in the Systems Operations team) and stabilise the hosting environment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As Team Lead of Systems Operations I was tasked with melding the team and then for us to work to provide a stable, robust, modern and scalable platform
for Infoxchange developed application hosting and product delivery and in a short time, with a small budget - we did just that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This 7~ year journey was exciting, rewarding and of course at times very stressful.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Theory of constraints</title><link>https://beta.smcleod.net/2018/01/theory-of-constraints/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://beta.smcleod.net/2018/01/theory-of-constraints/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="a-chain-is-no-stronger-than-its-weakest-link">&amp;ldquo;A chain is no stronger than its weakest link&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Any improvement made anywhere besides the bottleneck is an illusion.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Any improvement made after the bottleneck is useless because it will always remain starved waiting for work from the bottleneck.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Any improvement made before the bottleneck merely results in more ‘work&amp;rsquo; piling up at the bottleneck.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;em>Identify&lt;/em> the system&amp;rsquo;s constraint(s) (that which prevents the organisation from obtaining more of the goal in a unit of time)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Decide how to &lt;em>exploit&lt;/em> the system&amp;rsquo;s constraint(s) (how to get the most out of the constraint)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Subordinate everything else to the above decision (&lt;em>align&lt;/em> the whole system or organization to support the decision made above)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;em>Elevate&lt;/em> the system&amp;rsquo;s constraint(s) (make other major changes needed to increase the constraint&amp;rsquo;s capacity)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Warning! If in the previous steps a constraint has been broken, go back to step 1, but do not allow inertia to cause a system&amp;rsquo;s constraint.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>Those of us using technologies such as Docker and BTRFS or simply trying to gain a performance edge on the competition have a lot to gain from the features and performance of recent Kernel updates (especially from 3.18 onwards).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Search - A Journey of Delivery on a Budget</title><link>https://beta.smcleod.net/2015/02/search-a-journey-of-delivery-on-a-budget/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Feb 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://beta.smcleod.net/2015/02/search-a-journey-of-delivery-on-a-budget/</guid><description>Presented a Melbourne Search - July 2014 - &amp;lsquo;Search - A Journey of Delivery on a Budget&amp;rsquo;.
