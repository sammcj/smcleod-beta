questions\nwe value making work visible.\npart of this is achieved by us making an effort to ensure we\u0026rsquo;re asking for support and technical questions by starting a thread in our squads (or the relevant) room - instead of via of direct messaging (or calling) an individual.\nthis helps with:\nsharing knowledge amongst the team. identifying common problems that others might be having or aware of. balances support to prevent any individual getting overloaded. helps ensure a timely response. allowing others to keep up to date with ongoing issues. eases cognitive load by: reducing the number of notifications people receive reducing context switching. allows people to search for previously occurring questions and answers. highlighting documentation gaps. making work visible. for

quick development of new features and have stopped native application development.\n1password 8 is unfortunately an electron (chrome) web-frame application. this has a lot of negative implications for

you may wish to distill as is practical, but i implore you not to only pick the easier items - that\u0026rsquo;s missing the point. these can give you talking points when performing postmortems, retros and during times of conflict. platform engineering - team charter this team charter is an introductory document that sets the vision, mission, values, culture and communication protocols for our platform engineering team.\nteam vision / mission statement “to enable, empower and add value to the business, coworkers and customers by building, running, maintaining and improving the (cloud) platforms and services including infrastructure, automation, platform integrations and ci/cd tooling used by engineers and applications.”\nteam values we value focusing on outcomes rather than output. we value working on a trust, but verify model, utilising guard rails to help protect our systems while empowering our colleagues. we value small, easy to review, incremental changes over large, slow moving changes. we value that perfect is often the enemy of good. we value that rework is better than no work. we value finishing work over starting work. we value having empathy and respect for our peers. we value automation over manual tasks or changes. we value solutions that add business value over technical value. we value simple rather than complex solutions. we value the use of widely adopted tooling and solutions over creating bespoke development. we value pulling work over pushing work. we value working in small teams of 3 to 6 people. we value measuring our assumptions. we value fast feedback. we value change rather than fear it. we value open communication among the team. we value evidence based conclusions. we value loosely coupled, tightly integrated systems. we value breaking down silos and barriers, there is no us and them - only us. we value taking the sensible, applicable practices and ways of working from product delivery frameworks and cultural movements rather than trying to ‘implement\u0026rsquo; them. we value light touch interfaces, systems and processes over those that create toil (work you don\u0026rsquo;t want to do). we value sharing knowledge and have a centralised repository which can be searched by anyone in the organisation. we value that the people are more important than the tools. we value mistakes for the lessons they teach us. team culture and code of conduct we operate with and embrace an empathetic, blameless culture of psychological safety (everyone feels safe and no one is afraid to make mistakes, and can show and employ one\u0026rsquo;s self without fear of negative consequences of self-image, status or career). we respect each other\u0026rsquo;s time (work/life balance, start / finishing hours and timezones). we ask for help when we need it. we support team members when they ask for help. we operate as peers. we assume that the intentions of our coworkers are good. we expect that feedback should be constructive with the objective of uplifting and empowering those around us. we recognise and celebrate all individual and team accomplishments. we respect that people need to maintain a work / life balance in order to be healthy, happy and effective. we work collaboratively when possible and use a consensus approach when making team decisions but accept that the team lead may act as a tiebreaker or need to make final calls. we understand and appreciate that not all team members can have the same level of knowledge across all systems and tooling, from that we leverage that each individual adds value in different ways. when making major architectural decisions, we document the decisions made. when delegation is required, we agree to clearly communicate and make the delegation visible. team communication we try to listen rather than to hear. we try to understand the views and values of others. we value transparency so that we may learn from each other. we have agreed on and have documented our core working and core meeting hours. we communicate with constructive, positive feedback. we communicate with principled negotiation rather than positional bargaining. we communicate with direct feedback over indirect (slow) feedback. we prepare for and arrive on time for meetings / workshops whenever possible. we avoid holding meetings without value or without agendas. we avoid holding meetings too early or late in the day. we value asynchronous communication when appropriate (e.g. the message is not urgent, should be viewed by multiple people when suits them etc…). optionally consider adding a list of educational and source references (research, studies, books and journey stories) may be added.\nitems that need to be formalised (such as core working / meeting hours) must be documented in a company-wide knowledge base / wiki and become part of the team member onboarding process.\nreal world example to quote grant sutton from digio:\nback when i was on a team we used \u0026ldquo;rework is better than no work\u0026rdquo; as one of our core principles.\nthere were several times on the project where we could have been effectively stuck waiting of api specifications to be finalised.\nin those cases someone from the team would remind the other \u0026ldquo;rework is better than no work\u0026rdquo;, and we\u0026rsquo;d start working off whatever information we had, even if it was just content from developers in slack messages.\nthere were many occasions where the early development that we did either identified problems, or drove changes to the api that wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have happened if we had waited.\nsee also: grant\u0026rsquo;s post on \u0026lsquo;dev mantras — a team charter anti-pattern\u0026rsquo;\n","title":"DevOps Team

and testers over the years, but i am skilled in platform and pipeline engineering, automation, highly-available service engineering, distributed systems engineering, platform and service performance engineering and operations team leadership.\non term \u0026lsquo;cloud experience\u0026rsquo;: cloud, for me at least - means outsourced infrastructure and service / service endpoints.\ni\u0026rsquo;ve spent many years building private clouds, (mostly based on xen cloud platform, xenserver cloud, xcp-ng and kvm systems) and building out reliable, cloud-native, scalable and highly redundant services that are presented and endpoints to developers, testers or businesses directly - essentially i\u0026rsquo;ve been \u0026lsquo;building private clouds\u0026rsquo; more than i have been using \u0026lsquo;off-the-shelf\u0026rsquo; solutions like aws or gcp.\nhowever, i have dipped my toes in each and completed some aws training, at the end of the day i found that

took a 10 day holiday in fiji, lying on the beaches, reading, decompressing and enjoying the sunshine and chatting with the locals. a lot of reading and research (pitch anything, getting to yes, astrophysics for people in a hurry, the skeptics\u0026rsquo; guide to the universe, the code of the extraordinary mind). skimmed through several aws practitioner and best practise architecture guides (as mentioned, i\u0026rsquo;ve always designed and run cloud platforms - but not made heavy use other \u0026lsquo;off the shelf\u0026rsquo; options). completed the amazon aws practitioner essentials

project was to directly replace xenserver 7.2 with something supported and manageable for our traditional virtualisation needs.\nhigh level selection considerations i evaluated a number of options, with the primary candidates below.\nkey criteria (at a high level) i was evaluating:\nease of moving from our existing xenserver 7.2 based hypervisor clusters. security (architecture, hardening, monitoring, logging). cost (both licensing if any and self-support / management costs). vm performance (storage iops and throughput, network latency and throughput, processing latency, steal from over-provisioned workloads). management ui/ux and performance (for bau activities). management / cluster spofs, fail-over and redundancy. installation and upgrade process. update and security patching frequency. networking design and complexity. community (size, engagement, acceptance of suggestions / mrs). reliable live vm migrations. ease of management for a small team (part of a low tco). risk of vendor and technology lock-in. risk of survival (will it still be well maintained over the next 1-3 years). stability and reliability above practically all else. xenserver 7.6 (w/ paid license) for potentially priority support from citrix for issues. easy upgrade from 7.2. fresh installs and upgrades are simple, painless and easy to pxeboot, licensing can be a pain after install however. against slow moving development. incredibly expensive, it would cost us something like $140,800 aud per year (shelf price) for our 32 hosts (each with 2 sockets). features heavily restricted by licensing model. mostly older-fashioned enterprise users. no web management interface (although you can use xen orchestra from the folks behind xcp-ng). diminishing community since xenserver licensing changes in 7.3. poor storage performance compared to kvm based solutions. many outdated packages, while kind of based on centos 7, there are a great deal of packages from older releases or completely custom rebuilt. uses old technologies like ext3 and doesn\u0026rsquo;t support ssd/flash trim/discard functions. selinux not enforcing or supported. openvswitch still uses a lot of dom0 cpu (same as xenserver). dom0 often ends up limiting vm storage operations (tapdisk maxing out dom0 cpu). applying updates can be painful or at least slow, requiring binary iso files to be downloaded from citrix. uses jira for bug tracking (i just can\u0026rsquo;t stand the thing, it\u0026rsquo;s painfully laggy, give my gitlab or github over it any day). xcp-ng xcp-ng is a relatively recent fork from xenserver after it was open sourced, tracking upstream but clearly prioritising modernisation and community.\nxcp-ng: building an open source and turnkey virtualisation platform - talk/video fosdem for simple and painless upgrade from xenserver 7.2. fresh installs and upgrades are simple, painless and easy to pxeboot. updates are very easy and all provided via yum. rapidly growing and inclusive community. much more modern and easy to use forums. open source and without licensing to worry about or restrictions on features. live vm migrations are not only faster, but i am yet to have a vm fail to migrate. centos 7 based, and while still has many old packages (from xenserver) the developers and community are working hard to modernise these. much easier to submit bugs and mrs via their public repos than xenserver. a fantastic level of transparency of direction and challenges. you have the option of using xen orchestra has a web interface to manage xcp-ng. mdadm, kernel (some say \u0026lsquo;software\u0026rsquo;) raid support. promising support for openzfs. prioritising replacing old technologies built into xenserver, such as moving from ext3 to ext4 and working on a more modern kernel build pipeline. trim/discard for iscsi luns is in the works. efficient zstd import/export compression. the start of an exciting roadmap. (near future) enhancements for a new storage stack (smapiv3). (near future) enhancement to include vxlan support. significant initiative into research and development, partnering with several educational and scientific institutions. and lots of other enhancements being worked on and in the backlog. against poor storage performance compared to kvm based solutions (same as xenserver). selinux not enforcing or supported (same as xenserver). openvswitch still uses a lot of dom0 cpu (same as xenserver). dom0 often ends up limiting vm storage operations (tapdisk maxing out dom0 cpu) (same as xenserver). ovirt note: i found myself in a bit of a love/hate relationship with ovirt, while it\u0026rsquo;s performance and architecture was quite impressive, there were just too many problems with it\u0026rsquo;s install and upgrade process for me to really \u0026rsquo;trust\u0026rsquo; it for us. i do expect this to improve in the future, the community is very active and the product is moving quickly.\nfor solid technology that\u0026rsquo;s the upstream for redhat\u0026rsquo;s rhev. redhat backed. fantastic kvm performance that far outweighs any xen based distribution i\u0026rsquo;ve tested. decent web-based html5 management interface, could do with some ux but is constantly improving. best security model of the hypervisor distros i tested, selinux enforced on, clear hardening and best practise shows in configuration files and defaults. against messy, complex networking configuration. very complex and often unpredictable installation that often seems to fail on repeated identical installations. management is a floating vm which could be considered a spof. very long, slow install process. complex multi-step upgrade / update process. live vm migrations have been a mixed bag with vms randomly failing to migrate and ending up switched off but working perfectly at other times. could be a very time consuming migration from xenserver, but this goes for any xen-\u0026gt;kvm migrations (despite the various conversion tools available that i tried). proxmox note: while proxmox might be ok for a small deployment or home lab, i\u0026rsquo;d probably rather just run something like centos/fedora with kvm and kimchi for management.\nfor fantastic kvm performance that far outweighs any xen based distribution i\u0026rsquo;ve tested. easy install and upgrade (simply through apt). decent web interface for management, although lacking many options that must be set on the command line leading to some configuration confusion. against design seems to be lacking some general security / hardening awareness. selinux not just set to permissive - but completely uninstalled. had a very \u0026lsquo;home lab\u0026rsquo; feel to it\u0026rsquo;s architecture, configuration management and community. still required paid subscription for (some) updates. due to the odd way proxmox handles it\u0026rsquo;s configuration, it was going to be hard to decide what should be puppet controlled and what shouldn\u0026rsquo;t. networking configuration is more complex to manage, partly due to some limitations with the web based management interface. decision time as much as i would have liked to shift to a kvm based solution, i just didn\u0026rsquo;t feel that ovirt was a safe move for a small team.\nstaying and paying for xenserver seemed insane and i do not believe that the citrix xenserver project will live on for long other than in large locked-in organisations.\ngiven that we wanted a simple upgrade process to something that was maintained and had a good community xcp-ng ended up being the (almost) obvious choice.\nupgrade experience the upgrade from xenserver 7.2 to xcp-ng 7.6 couldn\u0026rsquo;t have been more easy.\ninsert xcp-ng iso (pool master first). select upgrade. repeat. switch to using xcp-ng centre rather than xencentre of course there is a lot we manage with automation (puppet), so i had to make some minor updates to our puppet manifests but that happened as xenserver major releases came out regardless.\nupgrade bugs we only hit two minor problems during the upgrade, thankfully i was warned about one and the other was an easy fix:\na bug in the upstream xenserver which meant i had to ensure the vm parameter platform:device_id was set to 0001 on all vms, otherwise they\u0026rsquo;d fail to live migrate during a pool upgrade, i did this simply ensuring it was set across all vms before the upgrade: xe vm-param-set platform:device_id=0001 uuid=b56f95fb-cb8f-86ce-5c7d-8efc2239f1db after upgrading from xenserver 7.2 to xcp-ng 7.6 hosts lost their iscsi iqn shortly after their first boot. i simply grabbed their correct iqn from our storage servers config (in hiera) and set it in xcp-ng centre for each host after they were upgraded.\nthree weeks with xcp-ng over the past 2-4 weeks i\u0026rsquo;ve upgraded two clusters with a total of 32 physical hosts and 240~ vms from xenserver 7.2 to xcp-ng 7.6.\nobviously while the xcp-ng upgrade itself is an easy process there was a lot of prior testing, peer review and then the hundreds of vms to live migrate and juggle for clustered systems, but - it went well with no impact to our internal business services or customers.\nso far, compared to xenserver, xcp-ng has been painless and the transition was easy for both myself and the team that uses it daily.\nwe have encountered no problems at all and both the product shows real progress and promise while the community has been active and supportive.\nthe future (for us) this project was to directly replace xenserver 7.2 with something supported and manageable for our traditional virtualisation needs.\nit\u0026rsquo;s worth mentioning that in longer term we will likely move to a mixed virtual environment.\nthis will likely involve container host nodes being directly controlled / orchestrated by kubernetes and some traditional hypervisor clusters (perhaps xcp-ng!) for traditional vm suited / stateful workloads.\nxcp-ng links xcp-ng website

only hope for survival, finding itself on a cruel, unpredictable rock surrounded by other species who seem far more adept at this whole thing (and to whom they are delicious), is the reliance on other, slightly older, half-formed brains. this reliance takes on a few different names as their story unfolds, like “love,” “culture,” “family,” etc. over time, and as their brains prove to be remarkably good at inventing meaning where there is none, the species becomes the purveyor of increasingly bizarre and sophisticated ironies. these ironies are designed to help cope with the species\u0026rsquo; loathsome vulnerability and to try and reconcile how disproportionate their imagination is to the monotony of their existence.\nibeyi - ash from wikipedia:\nibeyi is a french-cuban musical duo consisting of twin sisters lisa-kaindé diaz and naomi diaz (both 22 years old). the duo sings in english, french, spanish and yoruba, a nigerian language spoken in west africa and spoken by their ancestors before being taken to cuba as slaves in the 1700s. lisa is the lead singer and plays the piano;

with hp\u0026rsquo;s broadcom nic chipsets.\nwe were part way through a routine rolling pool upgrade of our hypervisor (xenserver) cluster when we observed unexpected and intermittent loss of connectivity between several vms, then entire xenserver hosts.\nthe problems appeared to impact hosts that hadn\u0026rsquo;t yet upgraded to xenserver 7.2. we now attribute this to a symptom of extreme packet loss between the hosts in the pool and thanks to buggy firmware from broadcom and hp.\nwe were aware of the recently published issues with broadcom/hp nics used in vmware clusters where nics would be bricked by a firmware upgrade. this issue is different from what we experienced.\nwe experienced extreme packet loss between hosts in the cluster. with xenserver, the pool master must be upgraded first. the result was that xapi pool management suffered a communication breakdown across the management network and complicated diagnosis. in fact, the connectivity problems went unnoticed until many hours after the master was upgraded.\nat first appeared as if it was a problem caused by the pool being partially upgraded.\nwe wondered if we had perhaps made a poor decision to run the upgrade on a single node for a few hours to observe its performance. we made the call to upgrade another host and analyse our findings.\nthe next upgraded hosts appeared stable. in fact we later found this host wasn\u0026rsquo;t impacted by the bug. we then made the call to upgrade several more nodes and continue to track their stability.\nafter upgrading half the pool, we suddenly hit problems. vms failed, hosts started dropping out of the pool and losing track of the power state of running/stopped vms.\nwe found that the master along with one of the other hosts were experiencing major packet loss on their management network cards. we suspected faulty nics as it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be the first time a broadcom had failed us and there is no physical network cabling.\nbroadcom has had its fair share of bad press over the years. many botched firmware updates and proprietary driver issues. i\u0026rsquo;m recommending people to stay clear from using network cards based on their chipsets.\ndowngrading the firmware as soon as we spotted the packet loss on the broadcom nics we upgraded their firmware to 2.19.22-1 with no improvement. we then upgraded to 2.18.44-1 / 7.14.62 again with no improvement. we even went as far as trying 2.16.20 / 7.12.83 from back in 2015 - but still no luck.\nat the time of writing this no firmware downgrades (or upgrades) have fixed the issue.\nthe packet loss manifests itself immediately after rebooting or power cycling. but - not on every reboot!. this is the odd thing - approximately half the time when booting a host it is fine until the next boot.\nwe\u0026rsquo;ve compared the dmesg, lspci and modinfo output between boot cycles, we can\u0026rsquo;t find anything that stands out.\nthe bug seems to be caused by the version of the bnx2x driver present in xenserver 7.2\u0026rsquo;s kernel. upon further reading hp recommends that you use bnx2x driver 7.14.29-2 or later, xenserver still uses the old kernel version of 4.4.0 - that\u0026rsquo;s not currently an option.\ni suspect that it\u0026rsquo;s a bug in the broadcom firmware loaded into the nic upon boot. i suspect a race condition related to the devices interrupt handling (msi/msi-x).\nxenserver xenserver needs to update its kernel or at least the bnx2x driver module past the version that triggers the bug. i\u0026rsquo;ve logged a ticket for this over at bugs.xenserver.org\nadditionally, xenserver didn\u0026rsquo;t notice the packet loss/network interruptions during the rolling pool upgrade. i have reported this concern and have suggested that xenserver adds pool wide checks for connectivity issues between hosts, at least during a pool upgrade.\nworkaround we don\u0026rsquo;t have (a good) one.\ncurrently we\u0026rsquo;re simply testing for packet loss after boot on the management nic. if detected we reboot the host and check again. this far from ideal - but until the bug is resolved there isn\u0026rsquo;t any other fix that we can find short of compiling a custom module for xenserver 7.2.\ngiven the widespread problems with broadcom, we\u0026rsquo;ve ordered hp 560m, intel based nics to replace them.\nbnx2x driver the driver included with xenserver 7.2 that triggers the problem is 1.714.1:\nfilename: /lib/modules/4.4.0+10/updates/bnx2x.ko version: 1.714.1 license: gpl #description: qlogic

handles, on an average node in the cluster with 120 small volumes connected to 3 fuse clients and no files i often see up to 1.5 million open files:\nroot@int-gluster-02:~ # lsof | wc -l 1042782 root@int-gluster-01:~ # netstat -lnp|grep gluster|wc -l 111 inconsistant configuration a big gripe i have is with the location of cluster and volume configuration, it is kept in a number of different files and file locations, for example:\n/etc/glusterfs/glusterd.vol /var/lib/glusterd/options /var/lib/glusterd/glusterd.info /var/lib/glusterd/vols/simpleapp_static/quota.conf /var/lib/glusterd/vols/simpleapp_static/trusted-simpleapp_static.tcp-fuse.vol /var/lib/glusterd/vols/simpleapp_static/bricks/int-gluster-01\\:-mnt-gluster-storage-simpleapp_static this makes managing the cluster and volumes with automation tools a bit of a pain and thus most tooling calls out to the gluster command line application to set and read configuration which is not ideal.\nmemory usage \u0026amp; leaks along the way with gluster from version 3.10 to 3.12 i\u0026rsquo;ve encountered many memory leaks resulting in ooms, corrupt volume configuration and often entire cluster rebuilds.\na lot of these seem to occur when making a large number of changes to volume configuration.\noften when gluster runs out of memory and gets oom killed, it corrupts .vol or .info files in /var/lib/glusterd/vols/\u0026lt;volumes\u0026gt;/, this causes the daemon to fail to start, requires you to hunt through logs for mentions of incorrectly configured volumes, delete the files in question and hope that they correctly sync back from another node, if they don\u0026rsquo;t or can\u0026rsquo;t be synced back it seems you might have to destroy the volumes (or cluster) and recreate them before restoring your (brick) data from backups - this is not at all fun.\npoor gluster cli performance again, because of the nature of cluter and volume configuration automation often has to call out to use the gluster cli tool to set or get information, this is made especially painful due to the tools performance - notibly how long it takes to set / get options on volumes.\nsetting a volume option on average takes around 1 second and the tool cannot set an option on multiple volumes at once.\nthis quickly adds up, suppose you have 200 volumes and you\u0026rsquo;re setting 5 options on each volume, 200*5=1000 / 60 - that\u0026rsquo;s 16.6 minutes just to set the options!, this could be a real issue when recovering from a disaster scenario.\nbroken links to gluster.org and gluster.readthedocs.io many times i\u0026rsquo;ve clicked on links to gluster articles or documentation and have found them to be broken, it seems that gluster.org has undergone changes and has not created redirects for existing permalinks.\n","title":"GlusterFS"},{"date":"2017-09-22","image":"https://beta.smcleod.net/2017/09/return-of-the-rss//melbourne.jpg","imageAlt":"","link":"https://beta.smcleod.net/2017/09/return-of-the-rss/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eOf

for any platform or brand.\nthe oneplus 3 i did a lot of research and decided to try the \u0026ldquo;oneplus 3\u0026rdquo; as it was good bang-for-buck, ran the latest software had plenty of grunt with the latest 8 core, high clock speed qualcomm processor coupled with 6gb of ddr4 - the specs really are very impressive, especially for a $400usd phone.\nhardware wise the unit is lovely, not as high build quality as my iphone 6s+ but not nearly as bad as the samsung galaxy s3 or other samsung devices i had tried in the past.\nhardware the good hardware wise the op3 felt like it was designed with more care than any other android phone i\u0026rsquo;d spent any fair amount of time. usb-c connectivity is great to see on a phone, it feels right at home on the device and opens a world of opportunities for accessories assuming the os supports them. the bad the camera felt about as a good as an iphone 4s which is now quite dated technology. wireless ac performance was just over 1/2 that of my iphone 6s+. the ugly while i loved that the phone used usb-c i was very disappointed to find that it was actually only usb 2.0. the 4g lte only gained about 2/3 - 1/2 the performance of my iphone 6s+ in the same location and on the same network. the software the good the os looked pretty, at first. i was please to see that the op3 used block level encryption by default. the op3 had selinux enabled, although i\u0026rsquo;m not sure what policies were in use. the device was fast and responsive at all times. the bad i started installing apps and finding my way around the os very quickly felt messy and like a chore. i noted that the general \u0026lsquo;quality\u0026rsquo; of android apps felt quite poor. nothing seemed to integrate very well, there was a real feeling that minimal time had been spent on the idea of usage flow on the interface. if at all and a lot of apps felt like they hadn\u0026rsquo;t been maintained for quite some time despite being the \u0026rsquo;the best option\u0026rsquo; available. notifications seemed to annoy me more often than they did notify me of important things. battery life was about 1/2 that of my iphone 6s+, although i was using it quite extensively. the ugly the platform was ridding with google specific apps, and it tries really hard to make you use them whenever possible. many apps required root access to the phone which is not something i wanted to do, similar applications on ios did not require \u0026lsquo;jailbreaking\u0026rsquo; which i have not done in many years, nor felt the need to. i had a go at disconnecting my from the clutches of google first by trying not to sign into any of their applications and disabling all the information reporting in settings, i felt like i was a bit like how ios was back in the iphone 3g days when you had to root the phone to do half the things you wanted.\ni then ended up flashing a custom rom that was pretty much stock, but without the good stock apps, i had to install the google app store and create an account which i think is fair enough because i couldn\u0026rsquo;t be bothered dropping custom downloaded apks and using that dreadful android transfer tool from my laptop which seems to work 4/5 times you plug your phone in, but like a lot of the apps in the ecosystem - felt very \u0026lsquo;javaish\u0026rsquo; (pun slightly intended).\nfinal words the op3 is a very impressive piece of hardware for $400 usd but i\u0026rsquo;m left with the feeling that google\u0026rsquo;s platform is fragmented and lacking work-flow and i was left with the over all feeling that google was watching my every move, i don\u0026rsquo;t know if it\u0026rsquo;s true or not but i certainly felt like i was google\u0026rsquo;s product, not the os.\ni look forward to a usable, non-android linux os image becoming available hopefully in the near future, then it\u0026rsquo;d be a handy device for tethering with and for mobile security analysis.\n","title":"The State of Android in 2016 \u0026 The OnePlus 3 Phone"},{"date":"2016-07-04","image":"https://beta.smcleod.net/2016/07/update-delayed-serial-stonith-design//noah-kuhn-27481.jpg","imageAlt":"","link":"https://beta.smcleod.net/2016/07/update-delayed-serial-stonith-design/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003enote: This is a follow up post from \u003ca href=\"https://smcleod.net/tech/2015/07/21/rcd-stonith/\"\u003e2015-07-21-rcd-stonith\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"a-linux-cluster-base-stonith-provider-for-use-with-modern-pacemaker-clusters\"\u003eA Linux Cluster Base STONITH provider for use with modern Pacemaker clusters\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis has since been accepted and merged into Fedora\u0026rsquo;s code base and as such will make it\u0026rsquo;s way to RHEL.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSource Code: \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/sammcj/fence_rcd_serial\"\u003eGithub\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://diptrace.com/download/download-diptrace/\"\u003eDiptrace\u003c/a\u003e CAD Design: \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/sammcj/fence_rcd_serial/tree/master/CAD/STONTH_CAD_DESIGN_V3\"\u003eGithub\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI have open sourced the CAD circuit design and made this available within this repo under\n\u003ca href=\"CAD/STONTH_CAD_DESIGN_V3\"\u003eCAD Design and Schematics\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eRelated RedHat Bug: \u003ca href=\"https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1240868\"\u003ehttps://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1240868\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e","tags":["hardware","storage","tech"],"text":"note: this is a follow up post from 2015-07-21-rcd-stonith\na linux cluster base stonith provider for use with modern pacemaker clusters this has since been accepted and merged into fedora\u0026rsquo;s code base and as such will make it\u0026rsquo;s way to rhel.\nsource code: github diptrace cad design: github i have open sourced the cad circuit design and made this available within this repo under cad design and schematics related redhat bug: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1240868 v1 vs v2/v3 versions of the rcd_serial stonith system the v2/v3 cables include the following improvements:\nhave a connector on the outside of the server (that\u0026rsquo;s female side runs from the reset pin \u0026lsquo;hijacker\u0026rsquo;) so that cables can be easily disconnected. have a slightly improved circuit design. have long thumb-screws on the rs232 serial connector that not longer accidentally unscrew the female rs232 connector in the server (whoops!). ![]({{ site.url }}/img/v3_cable.jpg) ![]({{ site.url }}/img/rcd_serial_v3_diagram.png)\n\u0026lsquo;hijack\u0026rsquo;

| psql test_badchar_utf8 chardecimal | description | column6_text -------------+-------------+-------------- (0 rows) the solution to find and replace characters in an sql_ascii encoded database which do not conform to the utf8 encoding requirements. this should be implemented as an sql script, so that the data can be updated on a live database, to mininmise the downtime required.\nthere is an existing script which will find the offending rows in a table: http://sniptools.com/databases/finding-non-utf8-values-in-postgresql\nwhile this will find the offending rows, it cannot do anything about it, as it stands. a more sophisticated script is required to actually replace the non-utf8 characters with something acceptable. two sql scripts are provided here, the first of these sql scripts is:\nreplace_non_utf8.underscore.sql this will replace all non-utf8 characters with underscores. this (at least) will allow the data to be imported successfully to a utf8 database. the second of these sql scripts is:\nreplace_non_utf8.html_equiv.sql will replace selected bytes with a utf8-sequence which corresponds to what is rendered by firefox when encoded as \u0026amp;#nn; where nn is the hexadecimal value of the byte. not all values from 80-ff are covered by this script. please add your own translations as required. any byte without a specific translation will be replaced with an underscore.\nthe triggers problem the functions process_non_utf8_at_column() and process_non_utf8_at_schema() work just fine, but if there are any \u0026rsquo;triggers\u0026rsquo; on the rows being updated, these triggers are also invoked. such triggers may expect a specific set of fields to be updated together, or increment sequence numbers.\nrunning these triggers would be an undesirable side-effect of what should be a simple text-update.\nthe locking problem the original solution was designed to minimise downtime, and these scripts would be ineffective if they were to lock table for anything more than a couple of seconds.\nunfortunately, this is exactly what happens if triggers are diabled per-table while updating the text like this:\nalter table _some_table_ disable trigger all; process_non_utf8_at_column(...); alter table _some_table_ enable trigger all; postgres wraps it all in a transaction, and locks the table until the update is complete (which can be minutes on a large table).\nthe non-locking, non-triggering solution a) don\u0026rsquo;t use alter table _some_table_ disable trigger all; instead, use a session-based setting:\nset session_replication_role = replica; this has the effect of disabling triggers, but does not lock the whole table while the function is running.\nb) don\u0026rsquo;t try to run the whole db in one go.\nthe following script does a search for offending table,column combinations, and then invokes process_non_utf8_at_column() on each of these individually.\nrun_process_non_utf8.sh sample db and outputs a test database can be created using the script:\ncreate_test_sql_ascii.sh this should be run as follows:\ncreatedb -e --template=template0 -e sql_ascii test_badchar ./create_test_sql_ascii.sh test_badchar when we run the script, we should see the following output:\n# psql test_badchar \u0026lt;

that\u0026rsquo;s a lot of logic for a stonith action. i\u0026rsquo;ve seen several pdus fail, it\u0026rsquo;s not pretty and often the management interface is the first thing to go. note: the following was v1 of the devices design, a post on the update v2/v3 design can be found here\nadam coy\u0026rsquo;s slightly modified version of the circuit that includes an indicator led and an optocoupler:\n![]({{ site.url }}/img/san/optocircuit.jpg)\nexample of where our supermicro reset hijack connects on the target node:\n![]({{ site.url }}/img/san/reboot_jumper.jpg)\nimage of the rear of a two node cluster with networking and rcd_serial stonith (v1) connectors attached:\n![]({{ site.url }}/img/san/storage_with_stonith_rear.jpg)\navailability update: this has since been added to rhel/centos and the official clusterlabs resource agents\nat present the rcd_serial stonith agent is available as part of the cluster-glue package, cluster-glue is not available in rhel/centos but can be obtained from opensuse\u0026rsquo;s centos7 repo or my own mirror.

i added --with-stonith to the rpmbuild command.\nthis is available from my packagecloud repo. cluster-glue opensuse provides the cluster-glue and cluster-glue-libs from their centos 7 repository\nthis is also available from my packagecloud repo. crmsh opensuse also provides crmsh from their [centos 7 repository]((http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/network:/ha-clustering:/stable/centos_centos-7/)\nthis is also available from my packagecloud repo. long term solution update stonith / fencing agents obviously the best solution however have a feeling that it will take some time for all the maintainers of the existing stonith / fencing agent developers to port their code to the new framework.\nrequest package to be built \u0026ndash;with stonithd redhat bugzilla host required packages i have been logging requests to various third party rhel repos asking if they would the missing packages.\nghettoforge are currently considering hosting pacemaker built --with stonithd in their gf-plus repo. rpmfusion elrepo if they don\u0026rsquo;t feel they have the resources or want to add them in for whatever reason, i will continue to host the packages myself on packagecloud and likely somewhere else as a fall-back.\nlast updated: tue jul 7 11:59:25 2015 last change: tue jul 7 10:57:16 2015 stack: corosync current dc: s1-san5 (1) -

sure buy the ticket, take the ride - get a unit that comes with a flash logo, a 500 page brochure, licensing requirements and a greasy sales pitch.\nour needs storage performance always seems to be our bottleneck at infoxchange, we run several high-performance high-concurrency applications with large databases and complex reporting.\nwe\u0026rsquo;re grown (very) fast and with that spending too much on off-the-shelf storage solutions, we have a requirement to self-host most of our products securely within our own control, on our hardware and need to be flexible to meet current and emerging security requirements.\ni have been working on various proof-of-concepts which have lead to our decision to proceed with our own modular storage system tailored to our requirements.\nrequirements reliability above all else ssd units must be durable network and iscsi failover must be on-par with commercial products (if not better) multiple levels of provable redundancy raid cross hardware-replication easy ip and iscsi failover using standard tools 1ru rack hight per unit 100% ssd only -

filesystems unfortunately the downside to xenserver is that it\u0026rsquo;s underlying os is quite old. the latest version (6.5) about to be released is still based on centos 5 and still lacks any form of ext4 and btrfs support, direct disk access is not available… without some tweaking and has no real support for trim unless you have direct disk access and are happy with ext3.\ndespite this, xenserver still manages to easily outperform vmware in both storage and cpu performance while costing… nothing unless you purchase support!\ndirect disk access it turns out, that you can add custom udev rules to pass through devices directly to vms.\nfor example, assuming /dev/sdb is the disk you wish to make available to guests, you can edit /etc/udev/rules.d/50-udev.rules like so:\naction==\u0026#34;add\u0026#34;, kernel==\u0026#34;sdb\u0026#34;, symlink+=\u0026#34;xapi/block/%k\u0026#34;, run+=\u0026#34;/bin/sh -c \u0026#39;/opt/xensource/libexec/local-device-change %k 2\u0026gt;\u0026amp;1 \u0026gt;/dev/null\u0026amp;\u0026#39;\u0026#34;

there are some limitations with this:\nyou\u0026rsquo;re passing through the whole disk and can only grant that entire disk to a single vm. the udev configuration is volitile and is likely to be lost upon installing xenserver updates. you cannot (to my knowledge) boot from directly attached storage devices. what i\u0026rsquo;ve actually done is partitioned the ssd raid array into 4 paritions on the xenserver host, this allows me to carve up the ssd raid array and present adiquit storage to several vms on the host. i.e.\naction==\u0026#34;add\u0026#34;, kernel==\u0026#34;sdb1\u0026#34;, symlink+=\u0026#34;xapi/block/%k\u0026#34;, run+=\u0026#34;/bin/sh -c \u0026#39;/opt/xensource/libexec/local-device-change %k 2\u0026gt;\u0026amp;1 \u0026gt;/dev/null\u0026amp;\u0026#39;\u0026#34;

than xenserver\u0026rsquo;s standard lvm or ext3 storage. there is less than a 10% difference in performance between the ssd raid array on the vm with the presented disk than directly on the xenserver host. xenserver\u0026rsquo;s raw disk performance was exactly the same as debian 7. remember to ensure your raid (and disk cache if not in prod) is enabled! points of note:\nthis is an old server, we\u0026rsquo;re not talking your latest and greatest hardware here, we\u0026rsquo;re talking giving new life to an old-ish dog so that it may retain its usefulness while remaining cost effective. with trim being unavailable when using raid, it is expected that the write performance will decrease somewhat overtime as the disks fill up as the disks will have to perform a ‘read, erase, write\u0026rsquo; rather than a simple write, to aid the lack of trim, i have left more than 25% of the disks unused as we simply don\u0026rsquo;t need 1tb of ssd storage on each of the hosts. we have some 1gb cache cards arriving in the following weeks which we will upgrade to from the 512mb cards presently installed - i expect this to significantly further improve performance.\nhardware refurbished hp dl360 g6 (2010 model). 2x 8 core xeon x5550 w/ hyperthreading, 8 cores presented to domu. 96gb ddr3 in dom0, 4gb in domu. hp p410i w/ 512mb cache. 2x 10k 146gb spindles for dom0. ‘hp genuine'! constant 5-6 watts each + cooling. 2x sandisk extreme pro ssd 480gb in raid 0 sata iii, read up to 550mb/s, write up to 515mb/s, random read up to 100k iops, random write up to 90k iops. 0.15-0.2 watts peak each. ext4 bonnie++ results w/ 2x ssd in raid1, xenserver 6.5 rc1, lvm:\n![]({{ site.url }}/img/xenserver/dl360-lvm.jpg)\next4 bonnie++ results w/ 2x ssd in raid1, xenserver 6.5 rc1, direct disk:\n![]({{ site.url }}/img/xenserver/dl360-dd.jpg)\next4 dd results w/ 2x ssd in raid0, xenserver 6.5 rc1, lvm:\nsamm@serv-dhcp-13:/var/tmp# dd if=/dev/zero of=tempfile bs=1m count=8000 conv=fdatasync,notrunc 8000+0 records in 8000+0 records out 8388608000 bytes (8.4 gb) copied, 118.11 s, 71.0 mb/s ext4 dd results w/ 2x ssd in raid0, xenserver 6.5 rc1, direct disk:\nsamm@serv-dhcp-13:/var/tmp# dd if=/dev/zero of=tempfile bs=1m count=8000 conv=fdatasync,notrunc 8000+0 records in 8000+0 records out 8388608000 bytes (8.4 gb) copied, 19.21 s, 437 mb/s future benchmarking steps\nobserve performance over time since trim is not available. upgrade raid cards to 1gb cache (we have some spares). try with our new gen8 bl460c blade servers, with locally attached p420i raid controllers and 2gb cache. try linux software raid with direct disks. xenserver\u0026rsquo;s future filesystems\ni would hope that both ext4 (and btrfs) support is added in the near future. with this i would expect auto-detecting trim support similar to vmware and hyper-v. direct disk access\ndirect disk access clearly offers massive performance gains, i would like to see xenserver add this as an easy to use option when configuring storage. non-volitile advanced configuration\nrelated to direct disk access, xenserver needs some form of non-volitle advanced configuration options. vmware, raw xen and kvm let you tweak many options without risk of loss after installing minor updates.\n","title":"XenServer, SSDs \u0026 VM Storage Performance"},{"date":"2010-06-10","image":"https://beta.smcleod.net/2010/06/bmw-e36-328i-manual-conversion-programming//ivan-angelov-ITEOjp8utXc-unsplash.jpg","imageAlt":"","link":"https://beta.smcleod.net/2010/06/bmw-e36-328i-manual-conversion-programming/","summary":"Reprogram BMW after doing Automatic to Manual Conversion Based on my E36 328is experience, written in 2010.\nAssumptions This guide assumes the following:\nYou have programmed a BMW ECU/DME before using DIS or similar.
